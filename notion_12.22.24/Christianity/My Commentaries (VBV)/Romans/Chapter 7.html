The law<br/>did not die and cannot die because the God laws are irrevocable.<br/>[Matthew 24:35, Isaiah 40:8] When you marry Christ you do not break His<br/>Law, rather you uphold it higher. When you come to Christ He stills asks<br/>that you love Him with all your heart, mind and strength. He still asks<br/>that you love your neighbor. He still asks that you dont covet, envy<br/>steal, hate, murder or dishonor your parents. Is unthinkable that the<br/>law should be revocable just as His laws of nature are irrevocable. When<br/>you get on an airplane you are not breaking the law of gravity, but<br/>rather you are overcoming its power by applying a greater law. The law<br/>of pull in aerodynamics. In the same way when yo come to Christ you do<br/>not break the law, you just fulfill it by the aid of a greater power,<br/>the Holy Spirit. #BL #DR 4: It is sad to see many people who claim to<br/>have died to sin and be alive in Christ. An although in many cases their<br/>death to sin, at least as far as an outsider can judge, is evident,<br/>their live in Christ is not so much. Yes they stop going to wild<br/>parties, stop drinking, quit bad habits but never get involved in any<br/>kind of ministry. Nobody at work knows their Christian because they dont<br/>witness, they read their bibles only when in service and their only<br/>prayer time is either during service also or 5 minutes in their car on<br/>the way to work. You just never can see fruit in these fellas. They are<br/>fruitless trees. They dont necessarily produce bad fruit, at least not<br/>in the branches that are available to your eyes, but neither do they<br/>produce any kind of fruit. In saying this I do not assume the position<br/>or authority to judge whether such people are true Christians or not. I<br/>cannot say whether they have been redeemed or not. Only God knows. What<br/>I do can say is that it scares me to death the possibility of ever been<br/>a dead tree. A tree with no fruit. There is not a single time in the<br/>Bible where a believer is referenced to as a tree without good fruit. In<br/>the same way, there is not an instance where a good thing is said about<br/>a fruitless tree. About barren trees we hear: Òthe wax itÕs at the rootÓ<br/>[Matthew 3:10, Luke 3:9], ÒCurt it downÓ [Luke 13:7], ÒThe cursed tree<br/>has witheredÓ [Mark 11:25], ÒThrow that worthless servant into the<br/>darknessÓ [Matthew 25:30] (although this last example was not in<br/>reference to a tree the premise is the same, the bad Servan had produce<br/>0 gains for his Master ). These trees without fruit are the same people<br/>that James refers to when he says that faith without works is death. May<br/>this fear shake us an encourage us to work for our good Lord. How is<br/>your fruit this day my friend? Are you bring any fruit? And if you are,<br/>what kind of fruit is it? Is its taste sweet and its aroma delightful?<br/>Do those who work with your or for you love to eat from it ? Or do they<br/>avoid it? Is it refreshing to others when they eat it? Or is it as<br/>venomous as a wild mushroom that poisons and kills the system that<br/>digests it? #GRN #DR 7: The word of God is the only mirror humanity<br/>without Christ hates to look at. Looking at the word of God without the<br/>appearance of Christ is like a compulsive eater or a person with a low<br/>self-stem. It reveals what youÕre doing wrong. It reveals your flaws and<br/>all your imperfections. ThatÕs what you need to get rid of your self and<br/>put Christ [Galatians 3:27]. Oh how beautiful is for a believer to look<br/>at GodÕs mirror, His word. For when we come face to face to it we no<br/>longer see ourselves, rather we see our glorious Savior everyday more<br/>clear as we grow. DonÕt worry if youÕve only been walking with Him for a<br/>few years and the mirror still looks a little blurry and you canÕt see<br/>Him very clearly yet. Do not worry if you have been walking with Him for<br/>decades and the mirror at times still gets blurry as you fail Him from<br/>time to time. He might look like a blurry tree now [Mark 8:24] but the<br/>day will come where we will see Him as He sees us and we shall know Him<br/>as we are known. What a glorious day [Galatians 3:2, 1 Corinthians<br/>13:12] #BR #DR 8: This is the very nature of our flesh. Albeit we live<br/>in the grace covenant, we are commanded to trust God, yet we find<br/>ourselves doing our will. We are commanded to go out to the world and<br/>preach the Gospel, yet we remain quiet. We are told to be renewed<br/>through our thinking, yet we use this same thinking to defend our ways.<br/>#BR #DR 13: Does God punishes sin with death only because He diverts<br/>doing it? Refute the thought. Rather, God gives such punishment to sin<br/>to emphasize its great serious damage to our lives and ultimately to our<br/>relationship with God #BR #DR 13: Did you know that the devil is not a<br/>creator? Did you know that in order to do his job he has to use that<br/>which God has created it? That is correct. Sin is not but a contortion<br/>of that which is good. Satan does not created sex, God did; satan only<br/>demoralize it. He did not created the tobacco plant, the poppy seeds nor<br/>the juice of grapes, God did. He only turned those into a weapon to<br/>destroy peopleÕs health and soul. Darkness is not a creation, it is only<br/>the absence of light, which God crated. The only creation that the Bible<br/>attributes to satan is lying when It calls him the father of lies. #BR<br/>#DR 15: This is the difference between a believer and an unbeliever:<br/>that the believer hates to sin, whereas the unbeliever delight in<br/>practicing it. This is a very accurate test we can run on ourselves to<br/>verify whether we have been born again or not. By simple asking to<br/>ourselves the question, How do I feel about sin? or even more<br/>specifically, how do I fell about MY sin? do I hate it, or do I feel<br/>frustration that God prohibits it? Am I glad that God has given me the<br/>power to not have to do it? Or am I constantly desiring it and planning<br/>on way I can commit it without others knowing? #BR #DR 18: There is a<br/>tendency in most of the unconverted world that all humans are naturally<br/>good, and that there is good in every human. We just happen to make<br/>mistakes which are a result of factors that many times are out of our<br/>choice or control, as our upbringing, our culture, our early education<br/>or our non early education. Paul refutes that idea completely by saying<br/>that nothing good dwells in our sinful nature. The only good that could<br/>ever be in us is not actually from us, but fro mGod; that is, His Holy<br/>Spirit. Hence, anyone who does not have the Holy Spirit dwelling in them<br/>has no good in them. Everything in them is corrupt. I know these are<br/>hard terms to accept if you are not a Christian but yet are an active<br/>charity champion or a good moral citizen. But God says all those things<br/>are not but dirty laundry to Him my friend. If you want the only good<br/>that could ever dwell in you you first must accept that nothing good<br/>comes from you. #YLW #DR 18: Note that it says nothing dwells in me, but<br/>immediately he clarifies what part of him he means: his flesh. This is a<br/>symptom of our carnality and something that even we believers deal with.<br/>However, we must recognized that also Something which is Good greater<br/>than the bad also lives in us: the Holy Spirit [1 John 4:4]. If all you<br/>feel within you is pride, jealousy, lust, greed, hate, and what not,<br/>without any sense of any good or remorse for feeling such things<br/>something is wrong. You cannot justify such attitude by blaming yourself<br/>and using this verse as your defense. There has to be a greater good in<br/>you that rebukes you for feeling such thing from time to time. There has<br/>to be in you a desire to put off those things and to not give in. #PPL<br/>#DR 19: If we read [1 Corinthians 4:4] we would assume that Paul lived<br/>an impeccable life without any mistakes. Yet, in this latter to the<br/>Romans he lets us into privacy. He acknowledges before our eyes that he<br/>made mistakes. That he also struggled against his flesh. That he also<br/>acted in ways that he should not have. Nevertheless, with all of that he<br/>can still say that he lives with the peace of a clear conscience. This<br/>is the kind of peace that the Lord promised to us [John 14:27]. Although<br/>this verse is far from being a condoning to sin, it does reminds us that<br/>we are bound to fail as human beings. Failure and making mistakes are<br/>the consequences of living in these rotten tents who are drawn by carnal<br/>desires. But how wonderful is to know that this does not make a child of<br/>God less of His child. How wonderful is to know that He is not a an ogre<br/>waiting for us to make a mistake so that He can disown us and smash us<br/>like a fly. But that rather He is a faithful Father that keeps cleansing<br/>our dirty spots and mending our wounds. How wonderful is to know that we<br/>He remains faithful even when we are unfaithful [2 Timothy 2:13]. My<br/>brother/ sister, was He unfaithful to you when you fell in fornication,<br/>adultery, pornography, lukewarmness or when you backslid? Or did He<br/>bring you to back to repentance and restored your relationship with Him?<br/>Was He unfaithful to you when you turned your back to His voice and gave<br/>into temptation or did He wait out the door ready for you to open it and<br/>dine with Him again? Did He cheat on you when you cheated on Him? Did He<br/>received you as a mere slave or did He threw Himself on your neck and<br/>surrounded you with His harms? Did he send you back to eat with the<br/>pigs, or did He killed the finest calf for you? Did He make fun of your<br/>nasty clothes and turned around because you stunk? Or did He give you<br/>new garments? IsnÕt our Father a beautiful Father? #RD #DR 21: When you<br/>feel overwhelmed by your sins and your failures and you feel like youÕve<br/>let your good Master down and the devil tries to lie to your heart by<br/>telling your mind that you are a fake Christian, nothing but an impostor<br/>who has not been saved, ask yourself how do you feel about His Word? Do<br/>you love it even though you unwilling break it? Is your heartÕs desire<br/>to obey and fulfill it? If you pass these test then they are very good<br/>sign that you have been born again and the spirit is at work in you for<br/>this is a particular attribute of a righteous man [psalm 1:2], something<br/>that the unconverted man does not possess. If you fail them, humble<br/>immediately and beg the Lord for forgiveness and a true conversion.<br/>Although it is sad to say that an unconverted man hardly worries about<br/>questioning his motives and actions. He assumes his righteousness and<br/>thinks all his ways are the correct ones [proverbs 14:12] so the fact<br/>that you are questioning your actions and running tests against your<br/>genuineness is a sign you are a child of God. Cheer up my brother. Get<br/>off the floor, while off your knees and let your great Saviour wash your<br/>feet and get out and keep walking. Oh youÕll fall again here and there,<br/>but make sure you come right back to Him for another wash. When you talk<br/>about a person being a clean person you do not mean they never get<br/>dirty, it just means they donÕt stay dirty. They like to clean<br/>themselves regularly. It is the same for a believer. A clean walk with<br/>the Lord does not mean we never get dirt on our feet, it just mean we<br/>have Someone who is still in the feet washing business [John 14:5] #BL<br/>#DR 24: The entire purpose of the law was to bring humanity to this<br/>point; the realization that we are captives of sin in need of a<br/>Deliverer. Someone who can meet the requirements of the Law since we<br/>cannot do it ourselves. Someone who can save us since we are incapable<br/>of saving ourselves. However, the hard part is to get someone to realize<br/>this fact. Many people today think they keep the 10 commandments by<br/>being good moral citizens, taking care fo their families and being a<br/>charitable person and therefore think, they do not need Jesus Christ,<br/>since they are self sufficient. My friend, we are all hopeless,<br/>wretched, filthy, evil creatures and we must come to the recognition of<br/>it as Paul explains here in this verse. #BR #DR 25: There are two kinds<br/>of sin. Meditated sins and spontaneous sins. in these two we can<br/>differentiate between a believer and an unbeliever. As believers we are<br/>not immune to sin, however, most of our sins, are unwillingful,<br/>unplanned, sins. Spontaneous sins that usually derive from the weak<br/>emotions of our flesh. And although meditated, planned sins do enter the<br/>lives of some believers, they are not the norm, but the exception. And<br/>every time I have seen them occur the have been the result of a<br/>disattended relationship with the Lord. They are the result of a much<br/>deeper problem than just our weak flesh. However, those sins that are<br/>meditated on, schemed and willing fully carried into execution are the<br/>norm for the sinner. Someone who has not been born again and thus has<br/>not had a transformation of mind [Romans 12:2]. Which one of these two<br/>are you responsible for in your live? Have you truly been born again? Or<br/>have you been lying to yourself and everyone around you? You can fool<br/>yourself, but you cannot deceive God. #GRN #DR<br/></p></div></article><span class="sans" style="font-size:14px;padding-top:2em"></span></body></html>
