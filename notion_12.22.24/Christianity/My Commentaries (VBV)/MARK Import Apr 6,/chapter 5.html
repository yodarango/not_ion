The man could actually not come to Him.<br/>The demons would not let Him. [Jhon 14:6] Perhaps he wanted to come,<br/>perhaps he was sick of living In that status, and it is my personal<br/>opinion that that’s the reason for which our Lord decides to cross to<br/>the other side of the lake. The fact that the man runs to Jesus the<br/>moment he sees Him tells us that he wanted to be delivered, And Jesus,<br/>the Good Master saw the cry of his heart, so He came to he. It is good<br/>to notice that Jesus not only went, He went in the middle of a storm.<br/>You know, that is why the song &amp;quotreckless love&amp;quot could<br/>never appear to me as sentimental. Yes He does Climb mountains for you,<br/>yes He does tear down walls to come after you. How do I know this? oh!<br/>My friend, the life of this wretched sinner full of God coming after me.<br/>#RD #DR Ê 2: This was the tribe of Gad who chose to stay on the other<br/>side of the river. There are consequences In staying halfway In God’s,<br/>don’t you tell me differently #OR #JVM Ê 2: The man came to meet Him<br/>because Jesus came to be met first. [1 John 4:19] #RD #DR Ê 4: Nobody<br/>but the Holy Sipirt was able to control Him. You can ony be controlled<br/>by sin or by the Holy Spirit. No middle ground. If you are not a<br/>follower of Christ I am sorry to break the news to you but you are<br/>controlled by sin my friend. Oh I know that you think you have your life<br/>all together and nobody can tell you what you do and that you are your<br/>own boss. But you are wrong. You are dead wrong. You only have two<br/>choices, sin or Christ. Oh no worries, though. He’s control of your life<br/>is Much, with capital M, different to what you think of when you think<br/>of control. It is a control that give you peace and makes you love Him<br/>more. It is a control that you want more of everyday. #DB #DR Ê 5: Any<br/>type of self-hurting is satanic. [The fact that you can think that you<br/>feel better by cutting yourself is gotta tell you something is wrong. If<br/>you know of someone that does this, they need your help! And if you do<br/>this to yourself, you need help!] #BR #JVM [#DR] Ê 13: Really? Is that<br/>it? Is that the eonly reason for which they wanted to be embodied in the<br/>pigs: to drown them? Yes it is, because their only purpose is to destroy<br/>that which God has created [John 10:10] #BR #DR Ê Ê 13: If Jesus<br/>listened to the prayer of these legion of impure spirits what makes you<br/>think that he is just simply and willingly ignoring yours, who are His<br/>child? [There is no such thing as unheard prayers for a child of God.<br/>You should be ashamed to say that you have a father that ignores you. He<br/>answers all of our prayers, we just don’t like the answer sometimes] #DB<br/>#DR [#JVM] Ê 15: What a contrast, how wicked one has to be that to strip<br/>naked the Man that has tried to cloth you your entire life. Yet, we cast<br/>luck upon His robes everyday with our sins. [Matthew 27:35] [Mark 5:15]<br/>[Luke 15:22] #BR #DR #CTRST Ê 15: is it Not that so beautiful about our<br/>God? That right after your sin, right after your mistake, right after<br/>your messed up situation He doesnÕt leave you naked, but rather, if<br/>youÕre willing to embrace forgiveness, He clothes you? Yes, just as He<br/>clothed the man in the cemetery who was demon possessed. Yes, just as<br/>the Father dresses the prodigal son. Yes just as He dressed Adam and<br/>Eve. HeÕs long been in this whole dressing business! Today, if you have<br/>been stripped naked by sin, He seeks to dress you my friend. Why donÕt<br/>you let Him dress you with His grace and mercy?! He will give you a belt<br/>of truth, a breastplate of righteousness, shoes of readiness, a shield<br/>of faith, a helmet of salvation, and a sword of life. [Ephesians<br/>6:14-17] I know you are tired of being a liar, double faced individual<br/>and always hurting those around you whom you love simply because you<br/>canÕt be of integer character. But He will buckle you up in truth! He<br/>will give you a character of integrity and sincerity. You think you are<br/>the most wicked person on this whole world and that what you have done<br/>has no forgiveness. Oh but He will give you a breastplate if<br/>righteousness so that no more corrupting and destroying feelings can<br/>touch your heart. He will dress you with shoes of the Gospel of peace so<br/>that you no longer have to live at odds and opposition with your enemies<br/>and so that you can even share with them about your new clothes! And<br/>when doubt comes, when trouble approaches and uncertainty hits you like<br/>a bucket of cold water, you will fear not. For he has given you a shield<br/>of faith in His word that everything that comes to your life is for your<br/>own good, even if you donÕt know how. Oh and you know how those negative<br/>thoughts of doubt, condemnation, inadequacy, and torment come? Yeah, He<br/>has taken care of that too. A helmet of salvation is included in the<br/>outfit, so that the assurance of your salvation never leaves your mind<br/>so that you can defeat any thought! Finally, He will give you a sword of<br/>Life. The life of His word so that not only can you defend yourself, but<br/>also fight back. &amp;quotGod Is In The Fashion Business&amp;quot #RD<br/>#DR #STI Ê 17: It is incredible but it is recorded. These people<br/>preferred pigs over Jesus himself, the Man that crossed the water to<br/>come bring them light and life. If the evil possessed man with a legion<br/>of demons in him could come and kneel God these people had to have a<br/>legion of legions of legions. Perhaps the evil spirits that drawned the<br/>pigs had not much difficulty finding a home. These individuals right<br/>here had wide open doors for them. #BR #DR Ê 19: Jesus agreed to the<br/>petition of the pigs and let them go where they wanted to but not the<br/>petition of this man who had just falled in love with Him and wanted to<br/>go with Him? Yes, why? because sometimes God says &amp;quotI have a<br/>better idea. What about we do something that is better for you? what<br/>about we do something that is out of your mind and will make you be even<br/>more in love with me?&amp;quot I know your desires to enter the<br/>ministry, I know your desire to do this and do that, but if God is<br/>saying no do not question Him. I promise you His plan is better. #DB #DR<br/>Ê 19: The error I have seen in my short life is with many a minister is<br/>the sad lack of balance between their ministry and their families. I<br/>have seen kids walk away from the path of faith due to lack of time and<br/>attention from their parents. I have seen marriages almost been split<br/>because of the same. Jesus, through this man lets us know that our main<br/>priority is not the people, but our own people. When coming to this<br/>verse I always think of my great pastor, Kenny Carpenter and his<br/>priority resolutions: God, wife, children, ministry, church. My friend,<br/>the closes equivalent i know to [Mark 8:36] is &amp;quotwhat does it<br/>profit a man if he can win the world but lose his family.&amp;quot #PNK<br/>#DR 19: Many times want to reach our city or even another country, when<br/>we have not even testified of this precious gospel to our own aunts,<br/>ancles, and cousins #PNK #DR Ê 23: God does not follow mathematical,<br/>logical, or even scientific rules. Those rules were created for mankind.<br/>It is not good to tie God’s work to a system or a specific method. I<br/>think any genuine Christian will realize that very shortly after coming<br/>to Him and I fear many times when we pray that is what we do. We give<br/>God boundaries or instructions as not only to answer to our prayers, but<br/>even how He ought to answer them. God has given you the privilege of<br/>asking Him to do something for you, what He hasn’t given you is he<br/>privilege of telling Him how. And because God is not restrained to a<br/>method I believe that He will move according to your faith. This man had<br/>the faith that required Jesus to come put His hands on the girl, the<br/>faith of the man in [Matthew 8:8] did not. It was not God’s power that<br/>fluctuated. It was the faith from individual to individual. Now you may<br/>say this man is clearly telling Jesus how to do it. It was not<br/>necessarily that the man wanted this method alone in particular, it just<br/>the method that his faith could pay for. In his eyes this was the only<br/>method Jesus could do it. When I say God has not given us the right to<br/>tell Him how to do things i speak of a desired or preferred protocol<br/>that we want God to follow even when we know there are many more<br/>available.Ê #GR #DR Ê 27: As referred to the note in verse 23, this<br/>woman had a different kind of faith, in her faith God did not need to<br/>touch her, she needed to touch God. What a beautiful thing. Among a<br/>multitude that wanted a touch from God she wanted God to have a touch<br/>from her. I am speaking her of a touch that goes far beyond the<br/>physical, for many has touched Him. I am talking here or a touch that<br/>will move God to action. How many times we spend our lives telling God<br/>to touch us, but yet we dont want reciprocate. We want the benefits of a<br/>sanctified life, but not the sanctified life itself. Our lives are not a<br/>song of worship, we hardly pray, read, fast and seek his will.Ê #GR #DR<br/>Ê 32: Jesus did not look around for those who did not want to find Him.<br/>There was a woman among the crowd that more than seeking to be healed<br/>wanted to be found. Her whole being rejected by men. Perhaps, just like<br/>every woman of her period and culture dreamed with a home. Having a<br/>house with children and a husband. Perhaps she dreamed about finding<br/>that ideal man for her, but here she is. Being rejected, outcasted and<br/>perhaps even made fun of because of her disease by men. But all of the<br/>sudden she hears about this One Man. He is sweet. Oh He is kind and<br/>tender to women. She has heard how He elevates and defends women like no<br/>man ever has. He is a fine Sir. compassionate and does not judge nor<br/>rejects. Therefore Jesus looked for her. Because Jesus will always, and<br/>hear me right friend, always, will find those who want to be found. #RD<br/>#DR Ê 32: Many people question what about those people in the remote<br/>areas of the world that have not been reached by the gospel? Well, we<br/>see here that everyone who wants to be found will indeed be found. Jesus<br/>did not start looking around for someone who did not seek Him. He looked<br/>around for someone who sought for Him. Thus, it is my conviction and<br/>experience through stories of many missionaries, that if there is even a<br/>man in the middle of a jungle who really wants to seek God He will not<br/>fail to send someone with His gospel, or even more, reveal Himself to<br/>that person through a supernatural experience that you and I, who have<br/>access to His word, will never know. #LB #DR Ê 33: Here we have the<br/>three steps to salivation 1. Trembling with fear. That is, she believed<br/>and knew that she was a dirty woman, by the standards of her day, who<br/>was not supposed to touch nor be touched by someone. So were we before<br/>Jesus cleansed us. We were nothing but forty sinners, in fear of hell<br/>and commendation. Hopeless and helpless in this world without Christ.<br/>Ê2. She came and bow down. After we acknowledge that we are lost sinners<br/>without Christ and that we are on our way to hell, we must humble before<br/>Him and recognize He is the Creator and we are the Creation. That He is<br/>above and that we are below. Before we get to see His face we must see<br/>His feet. And the final step 3. She confessed the whole truth. Not a<br/>partial version of the truth, but the whole truth my friend. We must<br/>confessed that we have sinned and confess our sins to Him. #GR #DR Ê 36:<br/>A great principle given by the Master of Creation. He ignored the<br/>negative voices. I certainly do not believe that god has called you to<br/>debate negative voices/ thoughts to your faith. He has called you to<br/>ignore them and keep believing. Keep having faith. Keep repeating to<br/>yourself that He is able. The doctors say there is no hope left? Good.<br/>He overhears that. Those around you say there is no remedy? That’s<br/>cools. He overhears that. The circumstances and reason itself say there<br/>is no way? Great. He is the way maker. He overhears that. Nature and<br/>Science say that is an impossible? Fine. To Him everything is possible.<br/>Your heart and mind fail you? Okay. He won’t, He created them both and<br/>He overhears that. When in times of doubt just remember His words<br/>&amp;quotDon’t be afraid, just believe&amp;quot #GR #DR Ê Ê 39:<br/>According to the gospel go Luke this girl was about 12 years old [Luke<br/>8:41]. Jesus is found here saying that this girl is not dead but asleep,<br/>which gives us another proof that children go to heaven. Now, I am not<br/>arguing that there is an age limit upon which God judges whether someone<br/>is a child or not. I believe that God gives accountability to each one<br/>of us differently as we all mature at different times. I think God will<br/>makes us responsible once we can differentiate from good and evil.<br/>Therefore, given the circumstances in our world, and specially in<br/>America, I could not argue that a 12 year old would be save give the<br/>even he or she perishes, for we are surrounded by a colossal amount of<br/>information and children this days seem to open their eyes at a<br/>tremendously early age. #LB #DR<br/></p></div></article><span class="sans" style="font-size:14px;padding-top:2em"></span></body></html>
