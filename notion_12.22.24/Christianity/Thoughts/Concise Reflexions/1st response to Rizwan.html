Also, sorry that I delayed my response I actually read your email yesterday mornign but  I did not want to respond withou some serious prayer and fasting for wisdom from God. I know that you like to be very careful when sharing your faith and you make sure you say the right things in the right way, and so do I.</p><p id="6ea33f20-43c7-479d-8725-81bf50e3fec4" class="">I rekon that you are  very zealous individual about your faith, and I commned you for that.

What am I here for? And Where am I going? are not light questions, as our eternal fate depends on what we decide to do with these.</p><p id="7b492155-a0ea-4d06-9c1d-80fcc23695e7" class="">I will attempt to explain in a few words. as you. I will make three points to keep it consice and hopefully easier to understand:</p><ol type="1" id="79de3aa9-6e48-4463-841a-f6349226d3d7" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li>How do I kow the God of the Bible is True</li></ol><ol type="1" id="54c9da25-a90c-4232-a750-62902f5b285c" class="numbered-list" start="2"><li>How do i know the Bible is the Word of God</li></ol><ol type="1" id="5d9cda7e-4335-4ecc-9875-c7f5928778d0" class="numbered-list" start="3"><li>How do i know Christianity is True</li></ol><p id="f7231465-73f0-48af-b3fa-1e6c85a9e741" class="">How do I kow the God of the Bible is True</p><p id="b68567bd-94b2-4337-b303-ccd76dc7dada" class="">Like I have said before, I have not always been a Christian. I have not always perhaps even believed in the right God. I tended to believe in a three gods. An older man, perhpas an oger you may say, who I associated with the Father and was waiting on me to do the wrong thing so that He could smash me like a bug, a younger adult, who didnt care if i lived a holy life or not, He could always forgive me and love me anyway. That is whom I belived the Son to be. And then a third figure with no hands nor feet, the Holy Spirit who I didnt even know who He was, I just knew that He was there kind of like the third person in heaven.</p><p id="4493aa33-e1a5-445b-b5ad-837ab9446346" class="">For the first 18 years of my life i lived like this. But you know, about that age i started falling into a depression that was growinf more and more everyday. I just felt purposeless. I didnt know what was i supposed to do in life. I had no plans, no goals, no motives to do anything. And that is when I decided that I would give a try to Christianity. All i did that one cool night of March was to get on my knees on next to my bed, and say &quot;God, if I am useful for anything I am available&quot; that was it.</p><p id="b3782b1f-b830-467c-b653-7c5decff12af" class="">I then, without noticing it, started having a hunger for reading the bible. So I began from Genesis to Revelation (First and Last books of the Bible). And a particular detail I started seeing each day more is that the three gods I believed in were not quite true. I started to see that in reality there were no three gods, but One God who communicates with His creation in three different ways, three different languages you may say.</p><p id="329743e1-b639-4e36-851f-600fa50ad9b1" class="">In the very first book, Genesis chapter 1 it&#x27;s read:</p><p id="ed3c5709-5e50-4fcd-9f1a-9d4ff8a67e65" class="">&quot;1: In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth...</p><p id="60bde1d2-01b6-4ca5-91b1-53a6730f1a75" class="">2: And God said, Let there be light...</p><p id="7525ae52-d36b-4582-b13e-283a23a9dd94" class="">6: And God said, Let there be a firmament...</p><p id="b3067b4a-0099-408d-88d9-2c173bc479a1" class="">9: And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place,   and let the dry land appear...</p><p id="ce34f55f-57ec-4143-aa45-d58164067866" class="">10:  And God said...</p><p id="6c071327-603f-4966-9c0e-3b1ea13048f7" class="">20: And God said...</p><p id="805bcee6-2c66-4a0c-9f1f-c323eeb138b5" class="">24: And God said...</p><p id="052c28ce-ca8b-4f33-8427-29fd74ec329f" class="">26: And God said...</p><p id="c51c6c31-1bd5-43cc-9ebf-72f3d2efeb50" class="">29: And God said...&quot;</p><p id="c5eabe39-8bf6-463c-8314-13c2fc611dcd" class="">And thus we see God as a creator of the whole universe. Not too long after that, we see in Genesis chapter 3 that the first couple He created, Adam and Eve, choose to sin. And thus, God has to cast them out of the Eden garden, but before He does, He pronounces a curse—the consequence of their sin—to each directly: the serpent, to the woman, and to the man.</p><p id="6c2bce2c-911b-4cd0-bfa7-55e9386684b0" class=""><strong>To the serpent, satan, He says:</strong> &quot;15: And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; He shall crush your head, and you shalt strike His heel.&quot;</p><p id="2c4b1f6e-71c2-4b71-a80f-5a690e8317b2" class=""><strong>To the woman, He declares:</strong> &quot;16: With painful labor you shall give birth to Children&quot;</p><p id="7faf22f0-8faa-4a7f-b591-6f64947bdb74" class=""><strong>And finally to the man: &quot;17: </strong>Because you have listened unto the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying, you shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for your sake; in sorrow shalt you eat of it all the days of your life;</p><p id="ee79a826-eb74-468b-9ed1-3de4635688c2" class="">18: Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to you&quot;</p><p id="0cdf7089-8b67-4dc1-9597-e2244f3eec7f" class="">Fast foward almost 3000 years from that, and God raises Moses, to deliver God&#x27;s people. When God calls Him Moses asks Him &quot;who shallI say has sent me&quot; (Exodus 3:13) and God says to Him od said to Moses, &quot;I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: `I AM has sent me to you&quot; (Exodus 3:14).</p><p id="ada9c659-160c-4fdd-9b97-4756b4432241" class="">A few years before Moses died he says in Deuteronomy chapter 18:</p><p id="514366ba-1112-424c-9d86-eb8b76448255" class="">&quot;The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own brothers.

Some hundred years later, one of the major prophets, Isaiah, tells us about this Messenger from God. He talks about Him not only as the offsrping of a woman, but also as the Chosen Messenger.</p><p id="1aa95043-3f92-4ca2-ae0f-2b6dfcc32010" class="">Of Him he says in the book of Isaiah chapter 9 verse 6</p><p id="ee20af06-9d37-49da-896d-b4acac69079d" class="">&quot;For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.&quot;</p><p id="1b440368-373f-499f-b966-3654ef47f2ee" class="">Then, once he talks about his Man as a child as the offspring promised, he talks about Him as a messenger, the Prophet Moses talked about—a suffering Messenger in actuality—in chapter 53:</p><p id="2ebb4742-041f-449f-8f89-e6dcb6de94d7" class="">&quot;1 Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?</p><p id="b5c73e19-4d7c-477e-bbf9-243a413773b2" class=""><strong>2 </strong>For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.</p><p id="351763b9-19e1-4194-9ced-529432bcf27a" class=""><strong>3 </strong>He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.</p><p id="63cf5603-df4d-4370-8832-8e8164ca2cca" class=""><strong>4 </strong>Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.</p><p id="c3c3c9d0-95e5-4b78-a3c4-68e168ad823d" class=""><strong>5 </strong>But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.</p><p id="6263aeff-4726-4cdf-b0fd-3aafea0ddb79" class=""><strong>6 </strong>All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.</p><p id="0979d09c-866f-42cd-b823-e79257dbbbba" class=""><strong>7 </strong>He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.</p><p id="12678217-3cc9-4abe-a624-c4b926e7e9d2" class=""><strong>8 </strong>He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.</p><p id="a149d4e8-b698-4318-9e9b-d65771824404" class=""><strong>9 </strong>And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.</p><p id="f632a57c-1e56-40a8-8bd1-5f5262ba417b" class=""><strong>10 </strong>Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand.</p><p id="562323eb-4caa-4bda-899e-56315dae4ee0" class=""><strong>11 </strong>He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.</p><p id="7c84e88f-012d-40cd-818d-d07b36a91215" class="">12 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.&quot;</p><p id="b8606df6-0a11-402c-a97f-2433a4253ff4" class="">About 700 years after this prophecy that Child is born in Bethelem, [Matthew 2:1], born not of a man, but from a virgin, by the powe of God no man was involved in the creation of this Child [Luke1:35].

The other half of the prophesy gets fulfilled once He dies on a cross as a sacrifice for the sins of the world and resurrects bodily on the third day. The sins that began with Adam and Eve first. By shading His blood on a cross. For God says in Leviticus 17:11 &quot; for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.&quot; Therefore there cannot be any forgiveness of sins without blood, this is the reason why Israel for so many years sacrificed lambs, because God was pointing them to the fact  that one day He would send a perfect lamb to pay for all of our sins and for oce, which were the words of John the baptists when He saw Jesus:</p><p id="4ef12966-c34f-4d57-95e0-2c691c3865f8" class="">John 1:29</p><p id="68be58d5-d3e3-46d1-90e6-04c0bf11f78b" class="">&quot;The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, &quot;Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!&quot;</p><p id="b1842e50-8bbf-4ac6-aaca-f9636b98e1e0" class="">At the same time He fulfilled the the prophecy of Isaiah 53, the Man of sorrows, acquainted with the deepest of pains, and disfigured because of the tortures of the Romans to the point where you should not even tell if He was a person.</p><p id="cc5d2fe3-2ac1-489e-b8cb-264a65c16139" class="">This the Son that was given as Isaiah said in chapter 9:6, it is for that reason that John says in chapter 3:16</p><p id="811a2f0a-8390-4ad2-a502-223ea463880d" class="">&quot;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&quot;</p><p id="9a53a86d-58d0-4707-ab13-c3d2a12ca49f" class="">And as if that was not enough, remember what i just mentioned a few lines ago about Adam&#x27;s curse &quot;Because of your sin the soil will bring up thorns&quot;?

He could not be just a prophet or teacher, for each prophet or teacher who claims to be God is firstly blaspheming and secondly we know they are lying. These are the only two choices we have when it comes to describing Jesus.</p><p id="034d5934-2313-47ee-8b08-5b7a425a7075" class="">I know the God of the bible is the True God because it makes the most sense to me Rizwan! I have analyzed other faiths, and I have studied other philosophies and I have come to see that in most religious systems it’s mankind the one who pursues God, it is mankind who is chasing and running after God and doing a multitude of righteous things and not doing a lot of other bad things with the hope that maybe, and just maybe, God will accept me. Not only that but God seems to be quite removed from humanity in most religious systems.</p><p id="85638450-23d4-4ba3-9cd7-92021c3ea457" class="">The peculiar thing about Christianity is that it worships a God who knows what pain and suffering is because He Himself chose to come down to suffer it. Therefore when I go to Him in prayer I am  not wondering whether He understands me or not, because i know He does, He also lived as a man, He also was rejected, mocked, poor, sad. He cried. As a matter of fact, that  is the shortest verse in the bible  &quot;Jesus Wept&quot; (John 11:35) And that is of great comfort to me. To serve a God who knows what tears are. Not only that but in Christianity it is God who has reached out to mankind first and I obey Him and serve Him not with the hopes He will take me in, but rather because He already has taken me in. In 1 John 4:19 it says &quot;We love because he first loved us.&quot;</p><p id="3056a9df-bf22-43da-8e3d-df33c5b79170" class="">You made a very good statement in your email &quot;For any message that comes from the Creator himself, it must be always accurate.&quot;</p><p id="95cae1c7-3e25-4087-8535-79b1cc06e406" class="">You know, that line right there is why I decided to listen to Jesus rather than to other men who have claimed to have revelation from God, because out of them all Jesus is the only one that has claimed to be the creator of the universe, and if I want to listen to someone who tells me how to scape eternal perdition I want that Man to be God Himself.</p><p id="dc53d363-8d7a-46f8-a8e5-7eb3721c96bd" class="">I just realized this is more of a book than an email and i didn’t even get to explain how i know the bible is True and why I am a Christian.
