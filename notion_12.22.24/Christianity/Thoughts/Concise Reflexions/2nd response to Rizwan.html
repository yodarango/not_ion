Seems like He is a little behind getting His true word out if the bible is not it.

The only thing in common among these three, the Quran, the Book of Mormon and the Watchman Bible is that they both negate Jesus Christ as Savior and God. That to me makes sense, why? Because we kneo the devil is a smart being, and is there is one single truth that he wants to keep from humans is that Jesus is Lord. People dont make copies of $1 dollar bills they make copies of $100 dollar bills because there is no value in making an imitation of something unless it is valuable.

This is in the book of Job, a book categorized by scholars and historians either as old as Genesis, the first book, or even older, which puts it not younger than 3,500 years old.

As it turns out, the Pleiades (also known as the Seven Sisters) is an open star cluster in the constellation of Taurus. It is classified as an open cluster because it is a group of hundreds of stars formed from the same cosmic cloud. They are approximately the same age and have roughly the same chemical composition. Most importantly, they are bound to one another by mutual gravitational attraction. Isabel Lewis of the United States Naval Observatory (quoted by Phillip L. Knox in <em>Wonder Worlds</em>) said, “Astronomers have identified 250 stars as actual members of this group, all sharing in a common motion and drifting through space in the same direction.” Lewis said they are “journeying onward together through the immensity of space.” Dr. Robert J. Trumpler (quoted in the same book) said, “Over 25,000 individual measures of the Pleiades stars are now available, and their study led to the important discovery that the whole cluster is moving in a southeasterly direction. The Pleiades stars may thus be compared to a swarm of birds, flying together to a distant goal. This leaves no doubt that the Pleiades are not a temporary or accidental agglomeration of stars, but a system in which the stars are bound together by a close kinship.” From our perspective on Earth, the Pleiades will not change in appearance; these stars are marching together in formation toward the same destination, bound in unison, just as God described them.</li></ul><ul id="7568b9e9-55a2-481e-9a95-f4141d89ef28" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc"><strong>Orion</strong><strong> Constellation</strong></li></ul><ul id="8a4b8b0c-0e32-4177-b3d3-ad3f57fca96e" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">The next section of the verse describes the Orion constellation. God once again challenged Job, this time to “loose the bands of Orion.” God was referencing the “belt” of Orion; the three stars forming the linear “band” at Orion’s waist. God appeared to be challenging Job in just the opposite way he had in the first portion of the verse. Rather than bind the Pleiades, God challenged Job to loosen Orion. Alnitak is actually a triple star system at the eastern edge of Orion’s belt. These stars (along with all the other stars forming Orion) are not gravitationally bound like those in Pleiades. Instead, the stars of Orion’s belt are heading in different directions. Garrett P. Serviss, a noted astronomer, wrote about the bands of Orion in his book, <em>Curiosities of the Sky</em>: “The great figure of Orion appears to be more lasting, not because its stars are physically connected, but because of their great distance, which renders their movements too deliberate to be exactly ascertained. Two of the greatest of its stars, Betelgeuse and Rigel, possess, as far as has been ascertained, no perceptible motion across the line of sight, but there is a little movement perceptible in the ‘Belt.’ At the present time this consists of an almost perfect straight line, a row of second-magnitude stars about equally spaced and of the most striking beauty. In the course of time, however, the two right-hand stars, Mintaka and Alnilam (how fine are these Arabic star names!) will approach each other and form a naked-eye double, but the third, Alnita, will drift away eastward, so that the ‘Belt’ will no longer exist.” Unlike the Pleaides clusters, the stars in the band of Orion do not share a common trajectory. In the course of time, Orion’s belt will be loosened just as God told Job.</li></ul><ul id="e6e375d8-16a1-47c4-894a-6353193d46f4" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc"><strong>Arcturus Constellation</strong></li></ul><ul id="36eda26b-f786-48d4-8145-39a36d11dd98" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">In the last section of the verse, God described Arcturus, one of the brightest stars in the night sky. God challenged Job to “guide Arcturus with his sons. While Arcturus certainly appeared in antiquity to be a single star, in 1971 astronomers discovered there were 52 additional stars connected directionally with Arcturus (known now as the Arcturus stream). Interestingly, God described Arcturus as having “sons” and Charles Burckhalter, of the Chabot Observatory, (again quoted in <em>Wonder Worlds</em>) said “these stars are a law unto themselves.” Serviss added, “Arcturus is one of the greatest suns in the universe, is a runaway whose speed of flight is 257 miles per second. Arcturus, we have every reason to believe, possesses thousands of times the mass of our sun… Our sun is traveling only 12 ½ miles a second, but Arcturus is traveling 257 miles a second…” Burckhalter affirmed this description of Arcturus, saying, “This high velocity places Arcturus in that very small class of stars that apparently are a law unto themselves. He is an outsider, a visitor, a stranger within the gates; to speak plainly, Arcturus is a runaway. Newton gives the velocity of a star under control as not more than 25 miles a second, and Arcturus is going 257 miles a second.

However, the Bible does not say that He immediately started with living forms of creation after he spoke matter into existence. You will never find that in the Bible.

As a matter of fact the bing bang could not had happened without light, for light is the medium of energy to all that exists. We know this thanks to Einstein, who tells us that Energy is equal to its mass multiplied by speed of light squared (E = mc^2). This light is not a light emitted by any star, this light exists as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Think about it, today, although you are thousands of miles away from me, we can still communicate real time thanks to the Electromagnetic Spectrum used by the every communication device. This the reason why we can have wireless communication. So now that we stablished the fact that light had to exists first before any creation, not in the form that we see, but in the form we do not see (CMB), let us look at the creation of the stars and the sun in verses 14 and 19. The word used for creation here is not Bara (out-of-nothing), but rather Hayah (put-into-motion/ form/ shape). Although the sun and the stars had already been created from the begging (Genesis 1:1), they were not functioning at the time God created the earth, all God did was put them into motion, which holds exactly what science tells us. The energy (light) was before the mass.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="352751d5-1774-489f-965b-012e82ee6d1a" class="numbered-list" start="3"><li>The Earth created on the third day: This once again, if we look at the word used is Haya (put-into-motion/ form/ shape), therefore there is nothing unscientific about it, the earth does not need the sun to be shining in order to rotate upon its own axis, so the earth was already rotating because it had been created in the beginning (Genesis 1:1) all God did was simply shape it with some modifications, thus we can still have a 24-hour period.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="f0c56e83-9a14-47e5-97d6-555d1608f002" class="numbered-list" start="4"><li>The earth created before the sun: The Bible does not tell us that was the way to was formed, we have already stablished that they were both created in the begging and the word Bara is not used in the verse you used.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="5a3adddf-5b0c-43f0-a207-23137279c9ba" class="numbered-list" start="5"><li>Vegetation before the sun: This is totally possible when we speak about light being before the sun, as a matter of fact modern science tells that one of the characteristics of black holes is that they emit light, in other words light comes from empty space as we have already explained. Therefore the plants could still be alive specially since we assume that the days were 24-hour periods and the plants could definitely be alive by the next morning when God set the sun in motion, otherwise how do we explain plants making it through the night on cloudy days when the moon light does not reach them? Vegetation would be impossible.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="9dddac11-bc78-45aa-83ef-7dd6dabded6e" class="numbered-list" start="6"><li>The lamps to rule day and night: It is good that you mentioned the Hebrew language, because I rarely study my Bible without having the original text in Hebrew and Greek side by side next to me as well as other resources helping me understand the context in the time it was written. I agree with you that the word used here means lamp, however it does not mean lamps having light of their own, otherwise how can we explain that the sun was created in the beginning (Genesis 1:1) but it did not start shinning till the fourth day? This lamps were clearly not emitting light of their own, thus, we can still preserve the 24-hour day which means that none of the errors you have pointed out so far hold true or rational.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="cf0ca62d-97e2-4fe6-b306-f0472122163c" class="numbered-list" start="7"><li>Will the earth last forever or be destroyed: this is actually a quite easy to solve question specially in the day we live in. Since you quoted Hebrew manuscripts when talking about the lamps in the sky, I hope you allow me to use original Hebrew manuscripts here as well. The word “Olam” used here has a more limited sense, meaning “Long duration” or “futurity.” We can find this same word in verses (Deuteronomy 15:17) and (2 Chronicles 10:3-4) detailing a long but limited period of time. the word, as it is used by Salomon denotes a relative comparison. When you compare the life of man with the age of the earth, the earth is quite lasting, figuratively forever. Think about it, today we use terms as “Daniel took forever to respond,” (lol), but did I took forever? No, we use that figuratively and relatively.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="401e1931-f848-4505-bdc8-a70305ea8084" class="numbered-list" start="8"><li>The pillars of the earth: Jus a few verses before this verse Job mentions the law of gravity, in verse (Job 26:7), therefore, job knew the Seth had no pillars, he knew the earth was flowering, what he is using here is a poetical term of ancient times to refer to the mountains, which seem to bear up the heavens since they point upwards. That was a poetic way to see them in ancient times, we can prove this by taking into consideration Mount Atlas which was represented as one of the pillars of heaven.

This does not meant that God is planning to make everyone a polyglot, this is a special gift that God gives to some people as He chooses. An experience that ti myself have experienced actually. I remember praying one time years ago as I was going thorough some difficulties in life and a power I could not explain took over my tongue and started speaking through me in a language I had no idea what it was but it sounded like an African tongue. This went on for 10 minutes the first time and about 1 the second time. From time to time, this still happens to me and it is something I cannot explain. An american friend of mine actually invited a muslim friend to church some years ago, and He was converted to Christianity because he heard my American friend speak farsi, a language that she had no clue what it was and she was glorifying Jesus Christ in farsi. This happened to an Italian lady as well who heard my friend speak Italian. I can go on and on of hundreds of times I have seen this take please.</li></ol><ol type="a" id="f6bc2ae8-da58-41ef-8b30-7f16a46e20a6" class="numbered-list" start="3"><li>“They shall take up serpents” this refers to the dangers of life not only serpents, we have stablished that the serpent in the Bible represents satan, I can also tell you innumerable stories personal and of friends that others have attempted to murder because they preached the gospel and when they were shot the bullets did not touch them although they were shot from less than 5 feet of distance.</li></ol><ol type="a" id="3f59b3cf-7943-478e-9808-cf125cb8de00" class="numbered-list" start="4"><li>“They shall drink poison and not be harmed” The scripture is nowhere suggesting that they should drink poison, it just simply stating a fact. If I say to someone, “you will know so and so because they have an internal tumor in their head and every time she or he touches his/ her head, it hurts to them” that doesn’t mean I am telling you “go touch their head” I am just stating the facts, I am explaining the products yielded by an action. One of my friends was poisoned by a lady and her husband because he was a Christian. They invited him to eat to her house and put poison on the food, my friend, as every true Christian prayed for the meal and nothing happened to him. I have seen people also come to Christ because they have done this to a Christian and they have seen that nothing has happened to them. When you have health insurance you dont go out and try to get sick, right? You have insurance just in case a certain circumstance arises. This is the context Jesus is using.</li></ol><ol type="a" id="93c3bc68-2ee2-41ba-a983-f12ba597d9a8" class="numbered-list" start="5"><li>“They shall pray for the sick and see them be cured” You should give a try to watch my church one Sunday, because this is incredibly common. We see people being healed by cancer and all kinds of deceased very often. I have seen paralytics get up their wheel chairs, people with a shorter arm being stretched, people given 4 days to live live for another 30 years. My own father is a miracle, according to doctors he should have died 25 years ago and he is as healthy as never even now in his late 50’s.</li></ol></li></ol><p id="06c2d3b7-10a9-4ce5-be03-f7e9669c6762" class="">————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————</p><p id="c3505442-3382-4d04-9c60-1a4972ffdd92" class="">I know this email is getting quite lengthy and there are still many points that need to be explained, but this email is getting is lengthy, but I want you to know that those are points, that just as all the ones above have an explanation and I WOULD LOVE to explain them to you if you wish me to because they actually symbolism that point to Jesus Christ.</p><p id="fefb1e59-dacd-40df-a28b-80be77dddb66" class="">I know that anything you mentioned comes from a sincere heart wanting the best for me Rizwan, and believe me, I want the best for you that is why I spent many hours of research and prayer and fasting while typing this post. Although I could send many contradictions that I find in the Quran, I will only ask you a few very honest, sincere, questions:</p><p id="6edf1d34-a8bd-4023-b141-27b4a3b3654d" class=""><strong>WHY I AM NOT A MUSLIM</strong></p><ol type="1" id="7d28cb8b-6755-418b-acf7-b1b10d988875" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li>Have you ever wondered why the islamic religious symbol is a moon?

I dont think I could serve a dictatorial god that at the end of the day might not even accept me although I gave him my all.</p><p id="860bdfd3-449e-455e-9ca6-7f19fad14f63" class="">I hope that you have seen that I have proved that there is not a single scientific point that it is in the Quran that was in the Bible first.

Al you have ever thought since you have been a kid has been the Quran, but have you ever been given the freedom to explore truth as I have and research other believe without fear of consequences like I have?</p><p id="128da74f-d864-4b03-a46f-909673464344" class="">Jesus Christ loves you Rizwan!
