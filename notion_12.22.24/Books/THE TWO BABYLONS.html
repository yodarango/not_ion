            4: No other city in the world has ever been celebrated, as the city
            of Rome has, for its situation on seven hills. Pagan poets and
            orators, who had not thought of elucidating prophecy, have alike
            characterized it as &#x27;the seven hilled city.&quot; Thus Virgil
            refers to it: &quot;Rome has both become the most beautiful (city)
            in the world, and alone has surrounded for herself seven heights
            with a wall.&quot; Propertius, in the same strain, speaks of it only
            adding another trait, which completes the Apocalyptic picture) as
            &quot;The lofty city on seven hills, which governs the whole

            7: The gigantic system of moral corruption and idolatry described in

            &quot;MYSTERY, Babylon the Great&quot; (Rev 17:5). That Paul&#x27;s
            “MYSTERY of iniquity,&quot; as described in 2 Thessalonians 2:7, has
            its counterpart in the Church of Rome, no man of candid mind, who
            has carefully examined the subject, can easily doubt. Jeremiah
            (Babylon is a golden cup on the Lord’s hand that she made all
            nations drunk) (revelations 17) Venus the goddess was a the woman
            with the cup on her hand In 18th century pop Leo stablished a woman

            15: In coming to such a conclusion, he plainly goes upon the
            supposition that the name Mizraim, which is the Scriptural name of
            the land of Egypt, and is evidently derived from the name of the son
            of Ham, and grandson of Noah, is not, after all, the name of a
            person, but the name of the united kingdom formed under Menes out of
            &quot;the two Misr,&quot; &quot;Upper and Lower Egypt,&quot; which
            had previously existed as separate kingdoms, the name Misrim
            according to him, being a plural word. This derivation of the name
            Mizraim, or Misrim, as a plural word, infallibly leaves the
            impression that Mizraim, the son of Ham, must be only a mythical
            personage. But there is no real reason for thinking that Mizraim is
            a plural word, or that it became the name of &quot;the land of
            Ham,&quot; from any other reason than because that land was also the
            land of Ham&#x27;s son. Mizraim, as it stands in the Hebrew of
            Genesis, without the points, Metzrim; and Metzr-im signifies
            &quot;The encloser or embanker of the sea&quot; (the word being
            derived from Im, the same as Yam, &quot;the sea,&quot; and Tzr,

            one,&quot;*6 and therefore in symbol he was represented, not only as
            a horned bull, but as at once a horned and winged bull-as showing
            not merely that he was mighty himself, but that he had mighty ones
            under his command, who were ever ready to carry his will into
            effect, and to put down all opposition to his power; and to shadow
            forth the vast extent of his might, he was represented with great
            and wide-expanding wings. To this mode of representing the mighty
            kings of Babylon and Assyria, who imitated Nimrod and his
            successors, there is manifest allusion in Isaiah 8:6-8
            &quot;Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that
            go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah&#x27;s son; now
            therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the
            river, strong and mighty, even the king of Assyria, and all his
            glory; and he shall come up over all his banks. And he shall pass
            through Judah; he shall overflow and go over; he shall reach even
            unto the neck; and the STRETCHING OUT OF HIS WINGS shall FILL the
            breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.&quot; When we look at such figures,
            with their great extent of expanded wing, as symbolizing an Assyrian
            king, what a vividness and force does it give to the inspired
            language of the prophet! And how clear is it, also, that the
            stretching forth of the Assyrian monarch&#x27;s WINGS, that was to
            &quot;fill the breadth of Immanuel&#x27;s land,&quot; has that very
            symbolic meaning to which I have referred viz., the overspreading of
            the land by his &quot;mighty ones,&quot; or hosts of armed men; that
            the king of Babylon was to bring with him in his overflowing
            invasion! [daniel: the wings of the first beast plucked out]

            41: Who so likely to get the credit of producing the horse as the
            great huntsman of Babel, who no doubt enlisted it in the toils of
            the chase , and by this means must have been signally aided in his
            conflicts with the wild beasts of the forest ? In this connection ,
            let the reader call to mind that fabulous creature, the Centaur,
            half-man , half-horse, that figures so much in the mythology of
            Greece . That imaginary creation , as is generally admitted ,, was
            intended to commemorate the man who first taught the art of
            horsemanship. But that creation was not the offspring of Greek
            fancy. Here, as in many other things, the Greeks have only borrowed
            from an earlier source . The Centaur is found on coins struck in
            Babylonia ( Fig . 16 ) , * showing that the idea must have
            originally come from that quarter.

            299 google: To the worship of the sun in the character of the “
            Revolver,&quot; there was a very distinct allusion not only in the
            circle which, among the Pagans , was the emblem of the sun god, and
            the blazing wheel with which hewas so frequently represented
            (Wilson&#x27;s Parsi Religion , p . 31 ) , “ but in the circular
            dances of the Bacchanalians . Hence the phrase, “ Bassaridum rotator
            Evan ” — “ The wheeling Evan of the Bacchantes ” (STATIUS, Sylv .,
            lib . ii . , s . 7, v . 7 , P: 118 ). Hence, also , the circular
            dances of the Druids as referred to in the following quotation from
            a Druidic song : - “ Ruddy was the sea beach whilst the circular
            revolution was performed by the attendants and the white bands in
            graceful extravagance” (DAVIES&#x27;s Druids, P: 172 ) . That this
            circular dance among the Pagan idolaters really had reference to the
            circuit of the sun, we find from the distinct statement of Lucian in
            his treatise On Dancing, where, speaking of the circular dance of
            the ancient Eastern nations , he says , with express reference to
            the sun -god ,“ it consisted= in a dance imitating this god &quot;
            (LUCIAN, vol . ii . p . 278 ). We see then , here , a very specific
            reason for the circular dance of the Bacch , and for the
            ever-revolving wheel of the great Centaurus in the infernal regions.

            55: If there was one who was more deeply concerned in the tragie
            death of<br />Nimrod than another, it was his wife Semiramis, who,
            from an originally humble<br />position, had been raised to share
            with him the throne of Babylon. What, in this<br />emergency shall
            she do? Shall she quietly forego the pomp and pride to which<br />she
            has been raised! No. Though the death of her husband has given a
            rude shock<br />to her power, yet her resolution and unbounded
            ambition were in nowise<br />checked. On the contrary, her ambition
            took a still higher flight. In life her<br />husband had been
            honored as a hero; in death she will have him worshipped as a<br />god,
            yea, as the woman&#x27;s promised Seed, &quot;Zero-ashta,.&quot; who
            was destined to<br />bruise the serpent&#x27;s head, and who, in
            doing so, was to have his own heel bruised.<br />There was another
            name by which Zoroaster was known, and which is not a<br />little
            instructive, and that is Zara-adas. &quot;The only seed.&quot;
            (JOHANNES<br />CLERICUS, De Chaldoeis) In WILSON&#x27;S Parsi
            Religion the name is given either Zoroadus, or Zarades. The ancient
            Pagans, while they recognized<br />supremely one only God, knew also
            that there was one only seed, on whom the<br />

            62 &quot;He&quot; (Zoroaster), says Justin the historian,<br />&quot;was
            said to be the first that invented<br />magic arts, and that most
            diligently studied the motions of the heavenly bodies.&#x27;<br />The
            Zoroaster spoken of by Justin is the Bactrian Zoroaster; but this is
            generally<br />admitted to be a mistake. Stanley, in his History of
            Oriental Philosophy,<br />concludes that this mistake had arisen
            from similarity of name, and that from this<br />cause that had been
            attributed to the Bactrian Zoroaster which properly belonged<br />to
            the Chaldean, &quot;since it cannot be imagined that the Bactrian
            was the inventor<br />of those arts in which the Chaldean, who lived
            contemporary with him, was so<br />much skilled.&quot; Epiphanius
            had evidently come to the same substantial conclusion<br />before
            him. He maintains, from the evidence open to him in his day, that it
            was<br />&quot;Nimrod, that established the sciences of magic and
            astronomy, the invention of<br />which was subsequently attributed
            to (the Bactrian) Zoroaster.&quot; As we have seen<br />that Nimrod
            and the Chaldean Zoroaster are the same, the conclusions of the<br />ancient
            and the modern inquirers into Chaldean antiquity entirely
            harmonize.<br />
