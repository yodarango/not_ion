We can safely reject the theory that he wished to do Jesus an indirect service by putting Him into a position in which He would have to make a bid for political Messiahship. It is equally difficult to believe that it was a matter of greed. Thirty pieces of silver is hardly a miser&#x27;s paradise and in the background of Old Testament symbolism (Zech. xi. I2; Exod. xi. 32) it represents the price of a slave. It is more probable that the disappointment which attended the realization that Jesus was not going to make a bid for political power led to his action. What he actually betrayed was probably the place and time at which Jesus could be most conveniently arrested than anything more profound like the fact that Jesus was or believed Himself to be the Messiah. An authority which could not have guessed as much from the events of the last few days was hardly an authority worthy of the name.</li></ul><ul id="fad93063-10b3-4734-b47a-226f9a12dae8" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">121: Now it is obvious that to claim to be Messiah was not in itself a blasphemous statement. If this were true, it would immediately condemn to frustration any expectation that a Messiah should ever appear and be recognized as such. The real difficulty lay in the kind of Figure that Jesus presented, claiming or being acclaimed as Messiah. Jesus was in fact condemned not for claiming to be the Messiah but for being the wrong kind of Messiah.</li></ul><ul id="e8fd8b1e-c63a-4301-b1a4-b9a53fafe722" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">122: He had been the Procuratorship was due to the rather cynical policy of Tiberius who prolonged governorships not only to avoid the necessity of making fresh appointments but also to ensure that a province should not be subjected to the tender mercies of too many governors all anxious to make their piles at the provincials&#x27; expense. The policy of Pilate towards the Jews vacillated between outbursts of violent repression and ill-considered acts of appeasement. Already two adverse reports had preceded him to Rome, and the third complaint to Rome was destined to prove fatal to his tenure of office. Before him the charge was altered from blasphemy against the Temple to one of high treason against Rome.</li></ul><ul id="f6f70282-880a-49c1-bb8e-a779a1b1cee9" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">132: According to him Moses gave 365 positive precepts (one for every day of the year) and 248 negative ones (one for every bone in the human body).

The word &#x27;Heaven&#x27; was for Jews at the time of our Lord (as indeed sometimes even today) a convenient periphrasis for God.

Here the background is also unmistakably Jewish. &quot;Binding and loosing&#x27; is almost a Jewish technical term for &#x27;allowing and forbidding. Thus St. Peter, previously described as the Foundation Stone and as the Grand Vizier of the Master in His Church, here appears as the authoritative Christian Rabbi, the wise scribe of the Kingdom of Heaven of another Matthaean passage. There is a verbal parallel in the Greek historian, Diodorus Siculus (I, 27), where the goddess Isis describes herself as follows: &#x27;I am the Queen of the Country, and whatsoever I bind, no man can loose&#x27;; where, however, the idea of binding and loosing is a magical idea. But there is certainly no hint of magic in the passage in Matthew. The Rabbis (like Islam after them) spoke of binding and loosing where they meant permitting and forbidding. Thus Josephus in a passage in his Jewish Wars (I, 5, 2) speaks of the Pharisees as binding and loosing at their pleasure in the sense of making authoritative legal decisions both positive and negative.</li></ul><ul id="61d20651-3c9c-4e4d-b8f3-3efdfa6e8873" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">280: [Luke 10:1-20] It is certainly worthy of notice that seventy is the number of the nations of the world in the Hebrew text of Genesis ×, while seventy-two (the variant in the Lucan passage) is the number according to the Septuagint text.

It might mean: &quot;Two swords are enough But enough for what? They certainly did not prevent the arrest, and Jesus rebuked St. Peter who used his sword in the defense of his Master. Possibly it might mean &quot;enough to prevent an unauthorized private attack, but there is little enough evidence that this was in the mind of Jesus.

A dishonest steward, knowing that he will shortly be found out, decides to make the best possible arrangements for himself after his impending dismissal. He therefore calls together some of his master&#x27;s debtors and suggests that they should scale down their debts to the estate for goods supplied by altering their bills or invoices. This is done, be it noted, in their own handwriting and not in his! The implication is that he will not altogether pass out of mind when the frauds are discovered. So far all is &quot;The Lord commended the unjust steward because he had dealt wisely. Who is the Lord, and why did He commend the unjust steward? &quot;The Lord&#x27; might either mean the master of the estate or our Lord Himself. In the first case, it might mean little more than a passing commendation of a clever rascal, but the second interpretation would be more difficult to justify. In any other Gospel except that of St. Luke the first would be the more probable, but in Luke there is a marked tendency to use the title &#x27;Lord&#x27; of Jesus even in the days of His flesh. This just tips the balance in favour of the more difficult rendering. If, then, the Lord in the passage is really Jesus, the difficulty remains, for what possible reason could He have for commending to our notice a particularly dishonest character? No one could regard him as a moral example. But it is worth noticing that the passage speaks of tho commendarion not for his good nos but as an example of the clever adaptation of means to ends. It is, capability of the sons of darkness in contrast with the dishonest inefficiency of the sons of light. Thus the approval which our Lord bestows on the man in the parable is limited and relative only. It is not that the sons of light should imitate his disciple honesty; it is rather that despite his dishonesty a through-and through rascal could teach disciples a lesson worth learning which would serve the good of the Kingdom. We may well remind ourselves once again that our Lord never promises any blessing to the inefficient but well-intentioned.</li></ul><ul id="50667d16-7713-4700-a16c-2472939fcbc2" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">333: A brief summary of the relationship between Jesus and His own family as it appears in the Gospels will serve to make this point clear. The exorcisms which Jesus performed in the early part of His Ministry led to the slander that Jesus was beside Himself, and that it was through Beelzebub, the prince of the demons, that He cast out demons (St. Mark III. 23-30). Immediately after this incident, and possibly in connexion with it, His human family came to see Him while He was teaching (St. Mark III. 31-5; St. Matt. XII. 46-50; St. Luke VIII. 19-21). The message reaches Him that His mother and His brethren were outside wanting to speak with Him. He replies by asking the question: &quot;Who is My mother and My brethren?&#x27; which He Himself answers: Whosoever does the will of God, the same is My brother and sister and mother, He thus enunciates a clear principle of detachment from His own family where the will of God is in question.</li></ul><ul id="92d5436a-b8b1-433c-a546-aa7403d2d27e" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">335: This last statement of our Lord is the true background of His teaching on divorce.

Hillel, however, refused to restrict the grounds for divorce to such narrow limits, and considered that it might cover even such trivial offences as spoiling a husband&#x27;s food by bad cooking. A later Rabbi of the school of Hillel, the Jewish martyr Aqiba, thought that it permitted divorce in cases where a husband found a woman who pleased him better, since that would be tantamount to finding something unseemly in his present wife.</li></ul><ul id="f732459f-b191-43b7-8cf2-589c46e4844f" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">351: Bible include a section (St. Mark xvi. 9-20) which is certainly not part of the true text. A comparison with the rest of the Gospel on the grounds of style, vocabulary, and even subject- matter suggest that it is by another hand; it does not read in the least like Mark. It is omitted by some manuscripts and replaced by interesting alternatives in others. Two fathers, Eusebius and Jerome, both learned in the text of the Scriptures and interested in questions of canonicity, declare it to be spurious. One manuscript ascribes its authorship to the presbyter Aristion from Asia Minor, and this would agree with the fact that its earliest witness is St. Irenaeus, who, although he was Bishop of Lyons in France, originally came from the same district. None of its rivals seems to possess any better claim to represent the original textof Mark. So far as almost unanimous critical opinion goes to-day, the Gospel ended at St. Mark xvi. 8.</li></ul></div></article><span class="sans" style="font-size:14px;padding-top:2em"></span></body></html>
