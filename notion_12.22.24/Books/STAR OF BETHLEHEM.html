But even if we extract Mark&#x27;s material from Matthew&#x27;s and Luke&#x27;s accounts, their Gospels still have a lot in common. Much of their material is focused exclusively on the sayings and teachings of Jesus, leading scholars to suggest that both Matthew and Luke relied upon another narrative besides Mark&#x27;s--either a written document, now lost, or simply a different oral tradition. This additional &quot; sayings<br/>&quot; narrative is known as<br/>&quot;Q.&quot; from the German word Quelle, meaning<br/>&quot;source.&quot;<br/>Interestingly, the tentative &quot;table of contents&quot; that experts have constructed for Q does not usually include the Nativity passages, even though Mark&#x27;s and Luke&#x27;s Gospels are the only ones to discuss the birth and infancy of esus.<br/>The Gospel<br/></li></ul><ul id="24b34d8f-ba0f-48e9-9df4-29f18c15c8b8" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">13: Matthew, or whoever wrote his account, misses an opportunity to highlight another prophecy-the one concerning the Star. This prophecy of the soothsayer Balaam, spoken centuries before the birth of Jesus, is found in one of Balaam&#x27;s oracles, and Matthew, being in command of Jewish scripture, would have known about it. It occurs in Numbers 24:17.<br/>I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near-star shall come forth out of Jacob and a sceptre shall rise out of Israel; it shall crush the borderlands of Moab and the territory of all the Shethites.<br/></li></ul><ul id="f8feb258-bfbf-49e4-bf3c-917d3ac9af79" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">19: The British astronomer and astrohistorian David Hughes, whom we will meet often in this book, has pointed out that if this account is literally correct, the Star would have had to be exceptionally bright, at least equivalent to the moon to be able to &quot;dim the stars.” [from a start to the moon? That’s a huge jump in brightness]</li></ul><ul id="34eba42f-3356-45d4-9925-883083309b59" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">25: In Matthew 2:2 we read in many of the older translations of the Bible that &quot;we have seen his star in the east.&quot; Grammarians will immediately recognize &quot;in the east&quot; as a dangling prepositional phrase, for this comment can be read in at least three ways: Was it (1) the Star, (2) the Magi, or (3) both that were in the east? Recent translations avoid this problem by using the translation<br/>&quot;at its rising, leaving &quot;in the east&quot; as an alternative.<br/></li></ul><ul id="81237708-ab5d-420f-9e20-7bc691a326ab" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">27: Nowhere in the Bible nor in the other texts does it state that the Star went before the Magi in their journey to Jerusalem; this comment is made only with reference to their journey from Jerusalem to Bethlehem. If the Star was seen in the east, at dawn, it is physically impossible for it to have appeared to &quot;go before them&quot; unless they came from a totally unexpected and highly unlikely re-gion. The reason is simple: if the Magi traveled from Babylon, Persia, or any other state in the east, the Star would have been behind them on their journey. They were traveling toward the west, so the sunset would have been in front of them and the sunrise would have been in the direction from which they came. This, of course, makes sense. The Magi, as we will learn more fully later, had been waiting for a sign, and once they saw it, they knew that they had to travel west to Jerusalem, as that was the capital of the Jewish world.</li></ul><ul id="f5d9442e-2ffc-4c9b-a8e0-e36d27201e42" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">28: Suppose we now take the biblical account at face value and accept that the Star did go before them and guided them as they traveled to Bethlehem from Jerusalem. Where must the Star have been in the sky if it were to do this? Bethlehem is just a few miles away from and almost exactly due south of Jerusalem. If the Star really did go before them, it was not in the east, it was in the southern sky at the time. In the time between the first sighting by the Magi and the arrival in Jerusalem, the Star had therefore swung around from the east to the south of the sky. This fact has been used by some experts to suggest that the Star was, in fact, a comet, because only a comet, of all the natural objects, could move this way.</li></ul><ul id="84ad08ae-7f58-42c2-ba9d-5d63e45a6413" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">29: If the Magi indeed came from Babylonia… the distance they would had to travel was 550 miles…the journey would have taken close to a month and a half…then the star could have moved to the south by the time the magi entered Bethlehem. </li></ul><ul id="c8ae7252-fef0-463d-a460-ad8f114a4ff5" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">34: A star will appear to rise about one hour earlier every two weeks due to the motion of the Earth in its orbit about the Sun. In one month the Earth moves through one-twelfth of its orbit, or an angle of 360/12 = 30 degrees about the Sun; that is, we see the<br/>stars advance, relative to the Sun, by 30 degrees every month. The Earth also rotates on its axis 30 degrees in one-twelfth of a day, or in two hours; that is, it takes two hours of rotation of the Earth to return the stars to the position they held one month earlier (see fig. 2.2). Suppose then, that the Magi, on leaving Babylonia, saw the Star in the east at dawn. Three months later, at the same time, at dawn, the Star would have moved 3 X 30, or 90 degrees, in the sky. Instead of being due east at dawn, it would now be due south at the same hour. The account by Matthew would thus be entirely logical if the Magi took around three months to arrive in Bethlehem after seeing the Star for the first time. If the Star had appeared a significant distance south of the celestial equa-tor, for example, it could move from its heliacal rising to being due south at dawn in just two months<br/></li></ul><ul id="92a11a39-bbe0-4360-95aa-254fb21dc52a" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">46: Astronomy gives us one of the key clues in this particular detective story. The Bible tells us that Jesus was born during the reign of King Herod the Great. Contemporary histories report that the death of King Herod occurred shortly after an eclipse of the Moon visible from Jericho, but before the feast of Passover. In other words, he died during a period of a lunar month (twenty-nine days) between the two events.</li></ul><ul id="c33d3647-5c87-4ce8-b1e6-99c630432417" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">48: King Herod must have died in late March or early April of 4 B.c.</li></ul><ul id="eb5c97e4-4ab9-4005-a381-cf3b91014036" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">51: If Jesus were one year old at the time of the slaughter-in the Gospels the Greek word used by Herod to describe the child means &quot;toddler,&quot; not &quot;baby&quot;.</li></ul><ul id="7d513a74-a572-4ba3-a98b-593611e29e13" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">55: The discrepancy can be explained in various possible ways. The first is to suggest that slow communications within the Roman Empire would have made it impossible for the census to be carried out before 5 or 6 B.C., even though the order had been given in 8 B.c. Although some outlying parts of the Roman Empire might have suffered from poor communications, this is not generally in accordance with what we know about Roman infrastructure and efficiency.</li></ul><ul id="e29fade1-2db4-4be0-b25f-6732d7881ac9" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">62: Therefore, at least in modern times, the shepherds of the region, although they are as hardy as ever, would not think of staying out on the hillsides with their flocks through the winter months. At this time of year the sheep are kept under shelter until lambing time approaches, when they are put out to pasture again. The time of year when the attention of the shepherds on a twenty-four-hour basis would be most needed would be March and April. In these months, as lambing occurred, the shepherds would need to be vigilant, protecting the flock from danger and helping ewes in distress. Luke&#x27;s passage suggests that the birth of Jesus was most likely to have occurred in early spring, around March, April, or perhaps May, at lambing time, or when the newborn lambs would still have required extra attention. Intriguingly, this time might also serve as the origin of the expression<br/>&quot;the holy lamb of God,&quot; which is used so often to describe Jesus.<br/></li></ul><ul id="00f16ebb-f597-445e-a97b-fbbefcbce5d7" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">63: It has also been suggested that the slaughter was on a much smaller scale than is generally believed because Bethlehem is, and was, a small town.
