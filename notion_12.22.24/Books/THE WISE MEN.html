Thus the<br/>Israelites carried down with them into Egypt the name of the East for the desert, kept it while there, and<br/>brought it back with them.

There he founded a k i n g d o m .; a n d t h e r e w e r e t h e a n c i e n t P e r s i a n c a p i t a l s ,Pasargada and Persepolis. W h e n the Persians thus<br/>came into Persia Proper,their kinsmen,the Medes,<br/>who appearearlierin history,dwelt inthe region ad<br/>joining it on the north. A century later,these kin<br/>dred tribes,coming under one government,ruled from<br/>the highlands east of the Tigris to the highlands west<br/>of the Indus, and from the Caspian Sea and the River<br/>Oxus to the Persian Gulf. The Persian Empire,thus<br/>founded in the sixth century before Christ (B. C. 558)<br/>by Cyrus the Great,besides Persia or Iran,embraced,<br/>at one time or another, Assyria, Syria, Asia Minor,<br/>islands of the Ægean , Egypt, parts of Arabia, of<br/>Scythia, and of India. In the fourth century before<br/>Christ (B. C. 331) Persia was conquered by the<br/>Greeks. In the third century before Christ the Parthians a tribe that had been subject to the Persiansrose up against the successors of Alexander,and at length founded the Parthian Empire. In the third century after Christ (A. D. 226)<br/>the Persians reestablished their own kingdom.<br/>In the seventh century (A.
